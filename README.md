Bits of code from my research rotation at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology on coastal current modelling using the program Delft3D. 

Code here primarily used for formatting data prior to use in Delft3D and reviewing basics in the Julia programming language.

Sub-directories:

mdfanno: for annotating MDF files for use in Delft3D FLOW

ge_bathymetry: for converting Google Earth kml files before import as bathymetry data into Delft3D
